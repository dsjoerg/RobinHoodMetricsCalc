			        		The Manhattan Nursing Aide Career Center (MNACC) provides training and job placement services to New Yorkâ€™s un- and under-employed,
			        		helping them find work as a nursing aide. This career track is a promising route out of poverty for a variety of reasons:
			        		it pays around $9.50 an hour, has reasonable education requirements, and is expected to grow as Baby Boomers
			        		keep retiring.

			        <div class="twoColumn">
			        	<p class="body">
			        		Another advantage for MNACC is that trainees are primarily women and may not speak English as a primary language, suggesting they
		        			would otherwise be disadvantaged in the job market.
		        			<br>
		        			<br>
							Here, the grant under consideration will pay for additional instructors and support staff, letting the Career Center handle
							additional trainees.
