        	</h2>
        	<p>
        		Figuring out the positive impact of a potential grantee is, unfortunately, only half of the equation. When
        		selecting which programs to fund, we also need to weigh their cost. Our ideal nonprofit does a lot with a little.
        		<br />
        		<br />
        		Another key factor comes into play here to help us only “take credit” for outcomes actually attributable to Robin
        		Hood. We call it the Robin Hood Factor, and it estimates what proportion of a given grantee’s activities are actually
        		due to our funding. If a charity uses their $100,000 budget to hand out 100,000 free meals and we gave them $20,000,
        		we only take credit for 20,000 meals - one-fifth, our share - not the full 100,000.
        		<br />
        		<br />
        		The Robin Hood Factor can still be 100% when we fund less than 100% of the program’s budget, however. This happens
        		when our funding is necessary for the program to take place or have an impact - qualifying for matching funding or
        		government grants is a common example.
        		<br />
        		<br />
        		Fill in the Manhattan Nursing Aide Career Center’s estimated funding requirements (from Robin Hood) and the Robin Hood
        		Factor and we’ll combine them with the estimated benefits from above to determine the ratio of expected, Robin
        		Hood-attributable benefits to Robin Hood cost. This benefit-cost ratio, the final link in the chain, is a big part
        		(but only a part) in whether we decide to fund an applicant grantee.
