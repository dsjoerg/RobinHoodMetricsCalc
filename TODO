DJ's todos:

* Remove pennies, they are distracting

* Round major displayed numbers to 3 significant figures

* Fix Navigation section.  It doesnt fit in visually, the word
  "Navigation" is unhelpful and indirect, it breaks the flow of
  reading.  It's not help when needed.  Maybe move it to the right?

* Fix popups in FAQ section.  Perhaps make hidden paragraphs rather than popups.

* Separate graduate-and-find-a-job from the question of how long they
  stay in that job -- it was confusing as initially worded.

* What percentage of those->What percentage of participants

* Move "Reset to defaults" closer to the calc

* Label the questions as Frequently Asked Questions?

* How valuable is one QALY -> What is the cost of one QALY

* For consistency, make the social discount rate work the same as other percent-based fields such as Robin Hood Factor
